__"A goal without a plan is just a wish"__


## Requirements
**What are the goals for this app?**
- Feth data from 2 different routes of the API
- Render multiple cards in the browser
- Map data received from the GET request onto those cards
- A button to display character cards
- A button to display episodes/location cards
- have some styling



## Outline
**How am I going to accomplish these goals
- 2 different routes, 2 GET requests
- Map multiple cards by using .map() with a card component
- Use buttons to change which cards are getting rendered (character, episode, location)
- Flexbox
