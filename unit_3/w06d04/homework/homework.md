1. What is a Single-Page Application (SPA)?

   A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.

   In a SPA, a page refresh never occurs; instead, all necessary HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code is either retrieved by the browser with a single page load,[1] or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions.

2. What is a Multi-Page Application (MPA)?

   Multiple-page applications work in a “traditional” way. Every change eg. display the data or submit data back to server requests rendering a new page from the server in the browser. These applications are large, bigger than SPAs because they need to be. Due to the amount of content, these applications have many levels of UI.

3. When we built our Unit 2 apps, were they a SPA or MPA, why?
   On the Unit 1 i have used SPA on my project using jQuery to render or delete specific data from the main content section. On the Unit 2 i have used MPA since i had to redirect to different pages using server.

4. Give two pros of a SPA

   a) SPA is faster than MPA
   b) it's easier to make mobile applications since backend can be reused

5. Give two cons of a SPA

   a) It is slow to download because heavy client frameworks are required to be loaded to the client.
   b) It requires JavaScript to be present and enabled. If any user disables JavaScript in his or her browser, it won’t be possible to present application and its actions in a correct way.

6. Give two pros of a MPA

   a) It’s the perfect approach for users who need a visual map of where to go in the application.
   b) Very good and easy for proper SEO management.

7. Give two cons of a MPA

   a) Frontend and backend development are tightly coupled
   b) The development becomes quite complex.

Let's refresh our memory on API's

1. What were the three great technical accomplishments of MPL?
   First, it served as a crack team which understood the infrastructure of the site and could resolve small issues as they arose.
   Second, it built an insurance application, called App2, which signed up new users in less than half the time of the original app.
   Finally, it replaced the website’s crashy login system with a functional (and much less expensive) one of its own design.

2. What does 'API' stand for?
   Application Programming Interface

3. What is an API
   It's a software that allows two applications to communicate
