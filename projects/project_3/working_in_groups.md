# Working in Groups

A tutorial on how to work in groups in the (tech) workplace

## How to tell if you're working in a group

If the answer to any of these questions is no, you're probably not working in a
group.

-   Are you asking and answering questions?
-   Are you talking to other people?
-   Are you looking at other people?

## How to create a good group environment

-   Ask your teammate how they learn best
-   Find out what your teammates' interests are outside of class/work
-   Ask your teammates what they struggle with/ what challenges they've had
-   Ask your teammates what they are good at
-   Remember that people often need sympathy before advice

## I understand everything we're supposed to be doing

What should I do?

-   Ask your teammates if they have questions
-   Ask your teammates how they're doing
-   Ask your teammates to walk you through their code/planning process
-   Listen to your teammates explain their issues and/or feelings
-   Ask your teammates how they feel about the project
-   Practice patience

What should I avoid doing?

-   Saying "This is easy."
-   Telling people not to feel the way they feel

## I'm confused about what we're supposed to be doing

What should I do?

-   Ask your teammates to pause what they are doing
-   Formulate a [clear
    question](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/full-stack-project/issues/7) if
    possible
-   Ask your teammates to walk through the code/planning process
-   Tell your teammates how you feel
-   If you are far enough behind that catching up would really hold up the
    project, identify the areas that you need to study, and ask for
    help/resources to learn that skill

What should I avoid?

-   Panicking. "I can't do this" is less productive than, "I can't do this yet,
    can you help me?"
-   Pretending that you understand. This will lead to bigger problems down the
    line.

## Things to Remember

Working as a team helps everyone, even if (maybe especially if) teammates are on
different levels. More experienced team members gain a deeper understanding of
the subject matter by explaining it to less experienced teammates, and the
process of explaining their code will help them better understand and evaluate
it. They will also learn how to explain things to people with different learning
styles.
