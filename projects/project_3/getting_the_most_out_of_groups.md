# What you will get out of group projects

## Goal

1. Stories, not product

## Interview process will go like this:

1. Non-tech person will make a decision to bring you in based on an arbitrary amount of time in the industry
	- sucks
1. If I am asked whether to bring you in, it is almost always yes
	- unless you are a front-end dev and we are looking for a backend dev
	- most people can learn new syntax/tech easily
		- what matters is ability to learn, not what has been learned
			- only exception to this is when we are on a tight deadline
				- never mattered yet
1. I will not look at code sample, final project, or resume
	- possibly scan code sample/final project for 30 secs
		- definitely not group project
	- am too busy
	- no matter how good any of your group/final projects are, they all suck. I do not care about any of them
		- no site built in a week can rival any of the production sites out there
		- javascript was invented in 10 days
			- unless what you did is on this scale, I don't care
1. I will make my decision within first 1-2 mins of interview based soley on our conversation
	- I can tell pretty quickly if you know what you're talking about
	- Shouldn't be stressful
		- You can't fake more experience than you have.
		- They're either expecting too much from a junior dev, or they're not
		- It's like a relationship
			- If you're a good match, nothing can break it
			- If not, nothing can keep it together
		- Go in and have fun.  You're fate is sealed.
1. If I get to the point where I ask "tell me about your experience working in groups," it's because:
	1. I'm satisfied with your technical skills
		- I'll cut the interview short, if I'm not
	1. I want to know:
		- do you know git
		- do you understand branching/pull requests
		- how to handle merge conflicts
		- how to separate tasks out so as to avoid merge conflicts
			- make sure only one person is working on one chunk of code at a time
			- can accomplish this by breaking things out in one of two ways:
				- by module on the page
				- along technological lines (HTML, CSS, JS)
		- **MOST IMPORTANTLY** can you work with different personalities

## How To Talk About Group Work

1. If you say, "I did a group project at GA, and it went great.  Do you want to see the site?" I will say, "no."
	- in my mind you lucked out with team members and have yet to really deal with group work
	- I do not need to see another site.
		- I've already decided on your technical abilities
1. Correct answer is:
	- Yes, I did a group project at GA. It went pretty well.
		- Here's what went well. Why?
		- Here are some problems we faced. Why?
		- These are some things I'm glad we avoided doing. Why?
		- These are some things I wish we'd done. Why?
	- Why is this a good answer?
		- Shows analytical thinking in regards to dev process
		- Shows an interest in constantly improving
		- Shows leadership qualities
			- If small company/full time employment
				- company is also thinking about
					- what you can do outside of being a developer
					- what you might do in a few years
						- management?
						- can you grow?
							- I know people who went to senior in just a couple years because of these skills
1. At this point I may be interested in seeing the site.  Demo the site:
	- What you worked on
		- Don't take credit for someone else's work.
			- You will be quized on it.
				- If you can't answer basic questions about how it works
					- You are lying about having worked on it
					- The interview is over
	- What others worked on
		- Don't trash it
		- What worked, what didn't, what wouldn't, what would?
1. Talk about having to deal with different personalities
	- If everyone got along great, you missed out on having something to talk about in your interview
	- If someone is really bothering you, see if you can resolve it within the group
		- Great to talk about in an interview
		- If you really come to an impasse, tell us.
1. If you have the least amount of experience in the group
	- Talk about how you learned from others
	- How you took direction and adapted easily
1. If you have the most amount of experience in the group
	- Talk about how you mentored others
	- How you debugged other people's code
1. Other noteworthy things you can do in a group
	- Planning/organization is incredibly important
		- Solutions Architecture
			- design structure of site
			- how will you divide up tasks so that there is little overlap/chance of conflict
				- by module
				- by technology
		- Project Management
			- design how the site will be built
				- who works on what
			- manage dependencies
				- make sure Person A finishes Module B quickly so that Person C can use it
			- SCRUM
				- take tasks and assign to everyone
				- each morning
					- check in to make sure everyone is on track
					- escalate any blockers
	- Managing personalities/keeping the group together and happy
		- This is an exercise in self restraint
		- Always monitor feelings for stress

## Remember: If it sucks, rejoice!  You have something to talk about.
