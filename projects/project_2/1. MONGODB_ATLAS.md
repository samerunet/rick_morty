# Create an Atlas Hosted MongoDB

## Intro

While developing an application that requires a MongoDB, you can only connect to your local MongoDB engine for so long.  This is because the application, once deployed, will have to connect to a MongoDB engine accessible via the Internet.

Heroku, the application hosting service we deploy our projects to, is capable of supplying a MongoDB.  However, delaying connecting to a hosted database until the time of deployment is not ideal...

It makes sense to set up and connect to a hosted MongoDB sooner, rather than later.  Doing this will ensure that any data, users, etc., created will be there upon deployment.

In addition, it's advantageous to use a service to host MongoDB databases other than Heroku so that you can create databases anytime you want.

The most popular service for hosting MongoDB databases, not surprisingly, is MongoDB's own [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

## Create an Atlas Account

First you will need to signup for a free account [here](https://cloud.mongodb.com/user?_ga=2.87815960.1293087282.1558635812-709388783.1558635812#/atlas/register/accountProfile):

### IMPORTANT
Be sure to assign yourself an organization/company: currently the set up will not be complete and not give you a helpful message if you don't do it... you'll just see a rocketship with a set up message ... for ... forever...

## Create a New Cluster

Once logged in, Atlas will request that you select a path. In this case, the free path will more than suffice, so be sure to select the free one!

For the free path, Atlas allows one free cluster per account and will ask you to create one. 

A cluster can contain multiple MongoDB databases - which Atlas refers to as **namespaces**.

Be sure to select the **Cloud Provider & Region** nearest to you

Next, in the **Cluster Tier** section, select the `M0 Sandbox` tier:

Finally, you can optionally change the name of the cluster, then click the `Create Cluster` button:

It may take several minutes for Atlas to build your cluster.

## Add a User for the Cluster

Each cluster must have a user created whose credentials will be provided in the database connection string when connecting to a database.

First click the **Database Access** tab:

Click the `Add New Database User` button, which will open a popup. On the popup, make sure you select the "Password" authentication method, then enter a username, password, select the **Read and write to any database** option, then click the `Add User` button:

## Update the Whitelisted IPs

Atlas has a security feature that allows the databases to be accessed by _whitelisted_ (approved) IP addresses only.

However, you must whitelist **all IPs** to ease development and deployment of your application.

Click on **Network Access**, click **IP Whitelist**, then click the `+ ADD IP ADDRESS` button.

In the dialog, first click `ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE` then click the `Confirm` button:

## Obtain the Connection String

To obtain the connection string for your `.env` file, first go back to the Clusters tab and click the `CONNECT` button on your cluster:

Select the **Connect Your Application** option:

Next, ensure that the **Node.js** driver and latest version is selected.  Then click the `Copy` button to add the connection string to your clipboard:

## Use the Connection String in Your App

You can now paste the connection string in the app's `.env` file, assigning it to a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, for example (please note your URL may look different, so make sure you copy yours!):

```
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://sei:<password>@sei-w0kys.azure.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true
```

You're almost done, but you need to update the connection string as follows:

1. Replace `<password>` with the password of the database user you created earlier.
2. The connection string by default connects to a database (namespace) named `test` (`...mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true`).  Change `test` to your preferred database name.  For example, "movies" (`...mongodb.net/movies?retryWrites=true`).

You're good to go!

## Viewing & Editing Data

FYI, you can use the Atlas app to view and edit data by clicking on the `COLLECTIONS` button.
